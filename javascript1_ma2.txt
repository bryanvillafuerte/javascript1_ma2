5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
	There are two types of scope in JavaScript Global and and local scope. It decides what code can "access" your code. Global scope is when you have code outside a function and all the code applies to it. If you have it inside only the code inside the function will apply. The way you make code local is to put your object inside the fuction.
